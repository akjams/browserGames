## Hopefully something like diep.io

### Technologies:
*   HTML5 Canvas
*   matter.js
*   TypeScript
*   socket.io

### Run
`npm start`

Check out the scripts in package.json for details.
We build the server with `tsc`.
We build the client with webpack and ts-loader so we can use modules. Apparently tsc can't do that for us natively.

### Notes
*   js files are ignored by .gitignore

### TODO
*   get a linter
